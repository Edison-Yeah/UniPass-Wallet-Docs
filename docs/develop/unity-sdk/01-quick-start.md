## Development Environment

- `UnityHub Verison: 2021.2.11f1`
- Third-party packages:
    - Vuplex for Android, Vuplex for iOS
    - Nethereum `v4.8.0`

## Setup

1. To start, you need to add [**Vuplex**](https://store.vuplex.com/webview/overview) and [**Nethereum**](https://docs.nethereum.com/en/latest/nethereum-smartcontrats-gettingstarted/) plugins into your project. You need to buy & import Vuplex.
    
:::tip
You can not load UniPass in Vuplexâ€™s CanvasWebView, because UniPass uses the encryption functions in the native browser. 
:::
    
2. Then add UniPass SDK into your Unity project as a plugin.

3. Finally, run it in C# code.
    
```csharp
using UnipassWallet;
```
